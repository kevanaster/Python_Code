# Python Challenge

This directory will house a challenge I did to showcase how I would use Python to template and validate a cisco BGP routing configuration. Some information has been altered and not verified to remove links to the challenge. 

I used two methods to validate, the preferred method is the code in [configure_network.py](configure_network.py) using NAPALM. The other method I used is ping to validate links are up between devices and that can be found with all the same configuration code but the validation code is different in [configure_network_ping.py](configure_network_ping.py).
